    "-   Collect match data from the Riot API.\n",

    "-   Parse and extract both pre-game features (champion picks, roles) and early-game features at 15 minutes (gold diff, kills, objectives).\n",

    "# Explainable AI (XAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- XAI = Explainable Artificial Intelligence; methods and techniques to make AI models transparent and understandable to humans.\n",
    "- **Global explanations**: Show which features are most influential on average across a dataset.\n",
    "- **Local explanations**: Explain why a specific prediction was made.\n",
    "- **Intrinsic vs Post-hoc**: \n",
    "  - **Intrinsic**: Models that are transparent by design (e.g., decision trees, linear models).  \n",
    "  - **Post-hoc**: Methods applied to black-box models after training (e.g., SHAP, LIME, counterfactuals).\n",
    "- **Visualization & communication**: Plots, summary graphs, or textual explanations make insights accessible for different audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros of XAI\n",
    "- **Transparency:** Users understand why a model makes a prediction.\n",
    "- **Trust:** Increases adoption by showing clear reasoning.\n",
    "- **Debugging & improvement:** Identifies if models rely on meaningful or misleading signals.\n",
    "- **Actionable insights:** Helps make decisions in strategy, operations, or coaching.\n",
    "- **Flexible communication:** Tailored explanations for technical and non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons and Dangers\n",
    "- **Complexity:** Adds extra steps to modeling pipelines.\n",
    "- **Misinterpretation:** Oversimplified explanations may mislead users.\n",
    "- **Trade-off with accuracy:** Simple interpretable models may be less accurate; black-box models need complex post-hoc explanations.\n",
    "- **Computational cost:** Methods like SHAP can be resource-intensive on large datasets.\n",
    "- **Partial explanations:** Some methods only approximate reasoning, which can be risky if users over-trust them.\n",
    "- **Ethical & safety concerns:** Revealing certain features or internal logic may expose vulnerabilities (e.g., security risks, sensitive data leaks).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Across Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Games (General)\n",
    "- XAI is used to explain AI behavior in a wide range of games, from strategy to simulation:  \n",
    "  - **NPC behavior**: Why an AI-controlled character made a certain move or decision.  \n",
    "  - **Dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA)**: Why the game adapts difficulty based on player performance.  \n",
    "  - **Analytics and predictions**: Explaining why an AI predicts a certain outcome or strategy is likely to succeed.  \n",
    "- Benefits: Helps developers debug and balance games, improves player trust, and provides educational insight into gameplay mechanics.  \n",
    "- Challenges: High-dimensional state spaces, real-time decision-making, and latent human factors like coordination or communication are hard to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### League of Legends (Specific)\n",
    "- Early-game gold, first tower, and objectives are strong predictors of match outcomes.  \n",
    "- XAI helps **coaches, players, and analysts** understand *why* a team is favored.  \n",
    "- Limitations: Some factors like team synergy, communication, or morale cannot be measured numerically.  \n",
    "- Goal: Make predictions interpretable and actionable in real time without compromising fairness or strategy secrecy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Science and Engineering\n",
    "- XAI explains results from simulations, experiments, or predictive maintenance models.\n",
    "- Enables **trust, safety, and accountability**: Users must understand why models make predictions that impact real-world systems.\n",
    "- Examples: AI flagging faulty machinery, medical diagnosis, or chemical simulations.\n",
    "- Challenge: Balancing **high performance** (accuracy) and **interpretability** is critical for safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical and Regulatory Considerations\n",
    "- XAI is increasingly required for ethical, legal, and safety compliance (e.g., GDPR in Europe, AI safety standards).\n",
    "- Certain aspects of models should **not be fully disclosed** to prevent misuse:\n",
    "  - Trade secrets or proprietary algorithms.\n",
    "  - Sensitive personal data in healthcare or finance.\n",
    "  - Safety-critical logic where exposing details could be dangerous (e.g., autonomous vehicles or critical infrastructure).\n",
    "- Regulation ensures transparency without compromising security or privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Explain and What Not to Explain\n",
    "- **Explain:**  \n",
    "  - Key predictive features and their contributions.  \n",
    "  - Model reasoning that impacts human decision-making.  \n",
    "  - Patterns that help users learn, plan, or optimize strategy.\n",
    "- **Do not explain fully:**  \n",
    "  - Sensitive data or personally identifiable information.  \n",
    "  - Internal logic that could create security risks.  \n",
    "  - Proprietary algorithms where disclosure is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Learning Takeaways\n",
    "- XAI bridges the gap between AI predictions and human understanding, making models more trustworthy and actionable.\n",
    "- Choosing the right model depends on **accuracy, interpretability, and domain needs**.\n",
    "- Safety, ethics, and regulations are as important as performance: what we explain and what we hide must be carefully considered.\n",
    "- Applications differ by domain: in games, clarity and strategic insight are priorities; in science or engineering, safety, reliability, and reproducibility are critical.\n"
